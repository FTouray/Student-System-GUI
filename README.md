# Student-System-GUI
A graphical user interface that added student details to a list and the modules that students are studying and display the results in the appropriate text areas using java swing. 
Details were entered into text fields and when the user clicked the submit button details would display in text area, if they clicked clear details in the text area would be removed. 
Modules were as checkboxes, when user clicked a checkbox that value would display, if they deselected the checkbox that value would be removed and if others were selected, they would stay.
